## ï¿½ Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

### File Organization

- **DO:** Keep all images in the `assets/images/` folder
- **DON'T:** Change file names randomly
- **DO:** Use the exact names referenced in your HTML

### Content
- **DON'T:** Leave placeholder text like "Your Name" or "Lorem ipsum"
- **DO:** Replace ALL placeholder content with your real information
- **DON'T:** Use fake projects or skills you don't actually have
- **DO:** Be honest about your skill levels and experience

### Code Changes
- **DON'T:** Change CSS or JavaScript if you don't understand what it does
- **DO:** Make small changes and test them immediately
- **DON'T:** Try to add complex features before mastering the basics
- **DO:** Follow the phases in order

## ï¿½ Troubleshooting Guide

### My Images Don't Show Up
1. Check the file name matches exactly (case-sensitive!)
2. Make sure the image is in the `assets/images/` folder
3. Try refreshing your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### My Website Looks Broken on Mobile
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Click the mobile icon to simulate phone view
3. Check if text is too small or buttons are too close together

### My Contact Form Doesn't Work
1. The form is just HTML - it won't send emails until you add a service
2. Follow Step 5 to connect it to Netlify Forms or Formspree
3. Test the form after setting up the service

### My Website Won't Deploy
1. Make sure all files are uploaded to your GitHub repository
2. Check that your main HTML file is named `index.html` (lowercase)
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to appear online

### I Made a Mistake and Broke Something
1. Don't panic! This is normal when learning
2. Use your browser's "View Source" to see the original code
3. Compare your changes to the working original
4. Undo recent changes one at a time until it works again
